        <h3 class="strong">JavaScript Prototypes</h3>
      </div>
      <p><span>Basic idea:</span> Protoypes are like the Ruby class in JavaScript; they provide the characteristics and basic ground work for any instance object created from that prototype</p>
      <p>Two interrelated concepts: (i) protoype property and (ii) prototype attribute</p>
      <p><span>(i) Prototype property:</span> allows you to add properties/methods to an object</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax: <code>object.prototype.name = value</code></li>
          <li><code>object</code> is the name of the object to add the property/method</li>
          <li><code>prototype</code> is standard syntax that refers to prototype for the object</li>
          <li><code>name</code> is the name of the new property/method</li>
          <li>the <code>value</code> can be a function or other value (like an integer or string or array)</li>
        </ul>
      <p><span>(ii) Prototype attribute:</span> the characterisitc of the object; normally referred to as the <em>prototype object</em>, from which an instance object inherits its properties/methods</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a prototype object is usually created as a constructor function, with various properties and attributes that can be passed down to instances of that prototype object</li>
          <li class="list-indent">
            <ul>
              <li>for example, the <code>Array</code> prototype object has certain properties/methods that are available to any new array object created</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Constructor function syntax: <code>function newConstructorName () {}</code></li>
          <li>New object syntax: <code>var newObject = new ConstructorName()</code></li>
          <li>a constructor can take in arguments, which would be initialized when a new instance of the prototype object is created, and it can include properties/methods, each must be written as follows:</li>
          <li class="list-indent">
            <ul>
              <li>Property: <code>this.propertyName = value</code></li>
              <li>Function: <code>this.functionName = function (){}</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>All inheritence is made possible through the prototype property</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A prototype object will pass down any properties/methods as part of that constructor function</li>
          <li>It will also pass down any properties/methods added using the prototype property syntax</li>
        </ul>
      <p>We can access properties/functions with the prototype attribute</p>
        <ul>
          <li>when accessing a property from an object (<code>object.property</code>) JS will first look to that object for the property</li>
          <li>if JS does not find that property in that object, it will go up the chain to that object's prototype to find the property there</li>
          <li><u>EX:</u> if we create an object literal (<code>var newObj = {}</code>) and we call a property that doesn't currently exist in our created object, JS will go up the chain to that object's prototype object</li>
          <li class= "list-indent">
              <ul>
                <li>in our case, <code>newObj</code> has <code>Object</code> as its prototype object, so JS will look there for any properties that are called that do not exist currently in the object itself</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="strong">JavaScript Objects</h3>
      </div>
      <p><span>Basic idea:</span> Objects contain property/value pairs that can point to a number of JavaScript objects, such as strings, arrays, and functions</p>
      <p>Two types of objects: (i) object literal and (ii) constructor functions</p>
      <p><span>(i) Object literal:</span> a way of creating an object that has property/value pairs; its prototype object is <code>Object</code></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax: <code>var newObj = { property1: value1, property2: value2 }</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p><span>(ii) Constructor function:</span> an object that is constructed as a function with property/value pairs; it can be a prototype object of its own</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax: <code>function newConstructor = { this.property1 = value1; this.property2 = value2 }</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p>Properties within objects can be assigned to objects themselves, as well as functions</p>
      <p>Two types of call notation: (i) dot notation and (ii) bracket notation (both apply to object literals and constructor functions</p>
      <p><span>(i) Dot notation:</span> causes a literal call to occur where JS looks for the exact property name that is called on the object</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax: <code>objectName.propertyName</code></li>
          <li>if JS does not find the exact property name in the object, an error will be returned</li>
        </ul>
      <p><span>(ii) Bracket notation:</span> JS will evaluate the property name called and return the appropriate value based on that evaluation</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax: <code>objectName["propertyName"]</code></li>
          <li>JS will either find the exact name in the object or, if the given property name points to another value, JS will move down the chain of values and see if that property name is in the object</li>
          <li><u>EX:</u> if we have a variable <code>var1</code> that is set equal to <code>property1</code> of our <code>newObj</code>, then if we call <code>newObj[var1]</code>, JS will see that <code>var1</code> points to <code>property1</code>, which is in <code>newObj</code> and return the value</li>
        </ul>
