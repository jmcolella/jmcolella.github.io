  <div class="about-text">
    <p>I am a developer. I took the plunge to change my career path and learn how to code. Dev Bootcamp helped me accomplish this goal, giving me the tools to become a full stack developer. I've built web apps using Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, Bootstrap, Materialize and Sinatra. When I was a film studies major at Columbia University, I developed strengths in design and analysis, which were keys to my success in navigating both backend and frontend work, allowing me to produce final products that looked as good as they functioned. I found that my abilities to effectively communicate and remain organized were instrumental in my work with partners and groups alike; with these two skills in particular, I believe I can seamlessly fit into a team and work efficiently with those members.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I am an avid homebrewer and all-around beer geek. You can usually find me at many of the major craft beer releases in New York City or judging at various homebrew competitions held in the area. Having studied film in college, I wrote my thesis on the Japanese film director Yasujiro Ozu and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge and appreciation of cinema by viewing both classics and new, independent features alike. I am also a skiing enthusiast, having skiied since I was ten years old. I try to make it up to the slopes a few times each year, hoping to hit the best powder the winter has to offer.</p>
