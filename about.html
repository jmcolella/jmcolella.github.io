  <section class = "font" id = "about-text">
    <p>A New Yorker born and raised, I earned my undergraduate degree in film studies from Columbia University. After graduation, I began working at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP as a paralegal in the real estate department. During my time there, I assisted associates and partners with securing multi-million dollar loan transactions to finance major residential and commcerical real estate projects in New York City and beyond. Wanting to pursue my passion for the film industry, I briefly left the firm to work with the Acquisitions team at Tribeca Film. At Tribeca, I worked with the Vice President of Acquisitions to track video-on-demand and theatrical performance of titles released by both Tribeca and its competitors. My work helped Tribeca to have a futher understanding of the changing landscape of the independent film industry, which helped the company create new strategies for purchasing film rights for their portfolio.</p>

    <p>Through both of these experiences, I did not feel a connection to either industry and believed that there was something else that might suit me better as a career. It was then that I began learning to code with simple tutorials in HTML, CSS and Ruby. While learning on my own, I saw that programming was a merging of my strengths in creativity, problem solving and organization, creating a fit that neither law or film had provided previously. I am now currently enrolled with Dev Bootcamp, learning more advanced HTML and CSS, as well as Ruby, Javascript and other useful languages. After graduation from Dev Bootcamp, I hope to take these new-found skills and position myself as a desirable candidate in the tech industry, with the ultimate goal of making a career for myself as a developer.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I am an avid homebrewer and all-around beer geek. You can usually find me at many of the major craft beer releases in New York City or judging at various homebrew competitions held in the area. Having studied film in college, I wrote my thesis on the Japanese film director Yasujiro Ozu and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge and appreciation of cinema by viewing both classics and new, independent features alike. I am also a skiing enthusiast, having skiied since I was ten years old. I try to make it up to the slopes a few times each year, hoping to hit the best powder the winter has to offer.</p>
