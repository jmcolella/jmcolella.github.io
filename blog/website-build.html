      <p>
        To bring Phase 0 of DBC to a complete close, each one of us in the co-hort is to take some time to reflect on the process of building a website from the ground up. For me, this process has been equal parts grueling and rewarding. I love creating and flexing my imagination, but fitting that creation within the context of HTML, CSS and, to an extent, JavaScript has been frustrating. It's not that I don't know how to write the code or that I don't enjoy it, it's just that translating design concepts to code and implementing that properly is not the smoothest process, at least it's not that way right now. There is still much more to learn and much more to fiddle with in regards to my site (Bootstrap maybe...?). I understand I'm just at the beginning of my learning process, but it's still hard to compromise in design even in the early going.

        I've truly learned the meaning of "going down the rabbit hole" through designing and building my website. I must admit, I've been pretty terrible at time-boxing when working on my site and this has led to some embarassingly long coding/design sessions to get my site to look exaclty (or almost exactly) how I have imagined it. Most recently, I spent probably 10 hours this week researching more CSS and completely redesigning my website...and I may just scarp it all to implement the Bootstrap framework! Honestly, I may never know when to stop. Well, maybe I will, but right now it seems like there will always be something to tweak and change or make better or make more responsive...it can become overwhelming! And it's this feeling of being overwhelmed by the options and choices that has led me so far down the rabbit hole at times that hours will pass before I finally pull my head out. Going forward, I think I need to be more dilligent about that; I need to really focus on trying to time box so designing and tweaking my website does not take up all of my time, considering that there are many other things I need to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        I must say though, I'm proud to be able to implement HTML/CSS with purpose and at least a modicum of skill. As I mentioned, I hope to understand the Bootstrap framework a bit more and implement in part, if not in full, on a final revised version of my site. I've made some good strides so far, and the product I have now is decently fuctional, but there's still more work to be done. This time, I hope, it won't lead me too far down the rabbit hole.
