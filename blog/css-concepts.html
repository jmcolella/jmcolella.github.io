      <h3 class="strong">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the second post on my Dev Bootcamp blog! I hope you learned a bit about git/Github from my previous post and are back to learn some more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this second post, I'm going to explore the differences between margin, borders and padding for an HTML element and how that works when styling using CSS. These three components of an HTML element are very important and can be crucial for spacing and positioning elements on your webpage. Alright, let's get started...
      </p>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">The Box Model</h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into margins, borders and padding, we need to take a long hard look at the box model. What is the box model? Well, simply put, it's an HTML element and the area surrounding it. Ok Ok, I know, that's incredibly vague. More specifically, the box model illustrates the various layers of an HTML element and how that can effect styling with CSS. When you write out an HTML element, such as "p", that element is literally treated as a box, with a width and height that can be adjusted. That element box, however, does not make up the total space of that element. Surrounding that element box is another box, called padding, which is then surrounding by another box, called border, and finally that is surrounded by a last box, called margin. By using and talking about the box model, particularly in CSS, we can see that any particular HTML element has a number of layers that effect how it can be positioned and spaced on a web page based on how we manipulated each of these box layers. If my description of the box model layers was a bit confusing, please see below for an incredibly succinct image that I hope should clear anything up:
      </p>

      <p>
        In this image, we can see the content of the HTML element itself surrounded by these literal layers that make up the box model. Believe it or not, all of these layers give us a lot of flexibility when styling a particular element. Let's get into how that can occur by discussing each separate layer of the box model.
    </section>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Padding</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start with the first, innermost layer: padding. Padding resides in between the actual content itself and the border. By adjusting the padding, we can set the white space surrounding an element, which is very important with spacing and can add some style, particularly in conjunction with a border. For example, if we set a border with some padding, then that border will not rest on the content itself, but will be separate from it due to the padding space, which could be aestheticially pleasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can adjust the size of the padding on all sides of an element by just using the padding selector and inputing a value, whether it's in pixels, em, or a percentage. You can also adjust padding for any particularl side of an element by using the suffix -top, -bottom, -left and -right when using the padding selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding can be very useful when spacing elements that are close to each other, utilizing the white space immediatetly around each piece of content to create some space on the webpage and assist with positioning to create the design intended.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Border</h3>
      <p>
        Next comes the border, which surrounds the padding layer and is used for basically stylistic reasons. The border layer, unlike the padding and margin layer, takes 3 different parameters: thickness, type and color. Thickness is very similar to setting the size of the padding, which can be adjusted in pixels or em. The higher the pixel or em number, the thicker, or bolder, the border will appear. In order for the border to appear, though, you need to set a type of border. The most common type of border is solid, which will display a solid line all around the padding of the content. You can also more stylized border types, like dashed, to create a unique look. And finally, if you don't want the default black border, you can adjust the color by inputting the specific nane, hex value, or rgb values to get the desired look. When writing this all our in CSS, you utilize the border selector and write out the three parameters as follows: thickness type color. No commas, no semi-colons, just spaces between each parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like with padding, the border can be set all around the element by simply using the border selector. However, if you want to fine tune the border for a particular side, or just want a border on one side of the element, you can use the -top, -bottom, -left and -right suffixes to accomplish that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding can be very useful when spacing elements that are close to each other, utilizing the white space immediatetly around each piece of content to create some space on the webpage and assist with positioning to create the design intended.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Margin</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, we have the margin. This surrounds both the border and padding, with which it shares some similarities. While padding sets the white space around the content itself, the margin sets the white space around the element of the content. So, for this paragraph I'm writing, I am using a "p" tag HTML, so if I adjust the padding, that would effect the immediate white space around the text itself, and if I were to adjust the margin, that would effect the space around the "p" tag as a whole. The different between the text and the "p" tag is a bit ambiguous, but it makes a different within the HTML/CSS, particularly in relation to other elements on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since margin is the white space around an element, it is very useful for spacing and positioning, just like padding. Adjusting the margin of an element can help move an element in relation to it's nested parent or it's sibling within a nested parent. Just like padding, margin can be set on all sides of an element by using the maring selector, or can be fine tuned for each side using the suffixes mentioned above. Margin is a very powerful tool that can easily create space between elements or push over an element to fine tune positioning and help create the webpage layout you desire.
      </p>

        <h3 class="strong">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Alright, I think we learned a lot here. We learned about the box model, which describes that each HTML contains a series of layered boxes, margin, border and padding, each of which can be manipulated to create space, add style and positon elements. Utilizing these three parameters of the box model can take your CSS skills to the next level and make your websites that much more interesting.
