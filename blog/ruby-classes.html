      <p>
        This week, I'm going to take a look at Ruby classes, along with instance variables and instance methods. Through this breif discussion, I hope you'll begin to see how powerful Ruby classes are and how you can use them to make an efficient, readable program. Let's dive in...
      </p>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Ruby class</h3>
      <p>
        Just like everything in Ruby, the Ruby class is an object. Unlike variables, arrays or simple methods, though, the Ruby class is a more complex object. What makes it more complex? Well, for starters, a Ruby class provides the ground rules for any instance object made of that class. What this means is that a class is a collection of methods and variables, all of which can work together to run a program for a particular object, or can just be used individually to complete small tasks. The best way to think about a class is as the Constitution for an object of that class; whatever is written within the class are the rules by which the object must obey. An object of a class, for example, cannot have a method passed to it if that method is not defined within the class; without the rules (code) for that method written in the class, the object does not know what to do when that method is called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some objects you are familiar with are instances of particular Ruby classes. For example, any string is an instance of the Ruby String class; same goes for an array, which would be an instance of the Ruby Array class. We are able to call various methods on string object and array objects because those methods are written out and defined within the class for that object. This is also why we can call some methods on arrays but not on strings; only arrays have those methods defined in their class.
      </p>
      <p>
        How exactly do you define methods in a class? How does Ruby even know what a class is? Well, there's some simple syntax we can use to create our own classes. Let's take a look below:
      </p>
       <code class="indent-code">class Pizza</code>
       <code class="indent-code">end</code>
      <p>
        OK great! We made a class called <code>Pizza</code> (if you were reading last week's post, we'll be keeping with the Pizza theme because why not)! But there's not much going on here. We kind of have this shell of a class; we didn't populate it with any methods (or instructions). If we were to create a new instance of the class like so:
      </p>
        <code class="indent-code">Margherita = Pizza.new</code>
      <p>
        our new <code>Pizza</code> object <code>Margherita</code> won't really be able to do anything. Within our Ruby class syntax, we can populate the class with methods and variables to give structure to any instance objects of that class. Let's do that now with our <code>Pizza</code> class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code class="indent-code">class Pizza</code>
        <code class="indent-code-level-1">def initialize(ingredient)</code>
        <code class="indent-code-level-2">@ingredient = ingredient</code>
        <code class="indent-code-level-1">end</code>
       </p>
       <p>
        <code class="indent-code-level-1">def print_ingredient</code>
        <code class="indent-code-level-2">p @ingredient</code>
        <code class="indent-code-level-1">end</code>
        <code class="indent-code">end</code>
       </p>
      <p>
        Alright, now we got some meat on the bones. We added two methods to our class: one called <code>initialize</code> that takes in one argument and the other called <code>print_ingreident</code>, which takes in no argument. So now, if we were to create our instance object <code>Margherita</code>, we have two methods we can call on that object based on the class it belongs to. We can <code>initialize</code> to store the argument we pass through as a variable within the class, and then use <code>print_ingredient</code> to print out the value assigned to that variable. How exactly to we achieve this process? That is where instance varaibles come in.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Instance variables</h3>
      <p>
        Looking above at our <code>Pizza</code> class with the two methods, do you see those variables labeled <code>@ingredient</code>? Well, those are instance variables that can store a value and then use that variable throughout the class, depening on if the variable is used. We know those are instance variables because of the syntax: the @ symbol denotes an instance variable. As mentioned, we can use instance variables to store values we may want to use throughout our class, particularly in different methods. In our <code>initialize</code> method, we have our instance variable <code>@ingredient</code> set equal to the argument passed through. This allows us to store the value from the argument as an instance variable, which we can then use in another method, like <code>print_ingredient</code> to do something with that value, like print it to the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to understand the differences between instance variables and local variables, particularly why you would use one over the other. As we've already noted, an instance variable is one that can retain its assigned value when used in different places within a class. In this respect, these variables have a global scope, since their value can be used anywhere. A local variable, on the other hand, has a local scope just as the name suggests. These variables to not retain their assigned values when used outside of the context in which they were created. For example, if you create a local variable within a method to store some value, you can only access that value within the scope of the method; if you try to use that variable outside of it, Ruby will return an error saying that variable is not defined. As you can somewhat guess from this brief discussion, instance variables are much more useful when you want to resuse a particular value, or set of values, throughout your class and in different methods. They have a permanence that local variables lack. Local variables are best suited for temporary assignments of information within a small-scale context.

        <h3 class="strong">Instance methods</h3>
        <p>
          So, we saw that a Ruby class can contain a slew of different methods, each of which can be called on an instance object of that class to execute a particular block of code. With our <code>Margherita</code> object, we can call <code>initialize</code> on it with an argument "Mozzarella Cheese", and then call <code>print_ingrdient</code> to then print out "Mozzarella Cheese" to the console. Both of these methods are called "instance methods" in Ruby. They get that name because they are methods defined within a class that can be called on instances of the class. That's easy enough: instance methods can be called on instance objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes are cool not only because of their instance methods, but also because of these other methods they can hold, called "class methods". Just like the instance method name suggested, class methods are those that are defined within the class and can only be called on the class object itself. In other words, a class method cannot be called on an instance object of that class; for all intents and purposes, instance objects don't have access to class methods due to the Ruby syntax. We can write out a class method for our <code>Pizza</code> class a follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="indent-code">class Pizza</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">def initialize(ingredient)</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-2">@ingredient = ingredient</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">end</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">def print_ingredient</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-2">p @ingredient</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">end</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">def self.base</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-2">@base = "Dough"</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-2">p @base</code>
          <code class="indent-code-level-1">end</code>
          <code class="indent-code">end</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          We added this new method, <code>self.base</code>. What this syntax is telling us that, for the <code>self</code> of the class <code>Pizza</code>, there is a method called <code>base</code>, which has some code that can be executed, in this case printing out our <code>@base</code> instance variable "Dough". We can call <code>base</code> on <code>Pizza</code> itself and get the desired result of our code. The class method is a very nifty tool to partition blocks of code within a created class, giving instance objects access to certain executions and not to others based on the type of method. A class method can hold information or perform calculations that instance objects should not be concerned with. For large, complex programs, class methods can be a way to safeguard information from access to any random instance object made from a class.

    <section class="text-over">
        <h3 class="strong">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Let's try to put this all together. In Ruby, there are objects called classes. Classes contain a collection of methods and variables, all of which provide the groundwork for any instance object created from that class. Ruby has a whole bunch of built in classes, like String and Arrays, but it also provides the syntax for the user to create their own classes with their own custom methods. Within classes, we can use instance variables to share frequently used information/values between different methods, in a way creating a connected ecosystem of code. We can then use instance methods or class methods to differentiate what type of obejcts can execute the code in the class or have access to information stored as variables (either local or global). It's important to come away with the idea that Ruby classes are incredibly useful to consolidate code into one "family", of sorts, and give the user a lot of freedom to customize their programs to make them run efficiently.
