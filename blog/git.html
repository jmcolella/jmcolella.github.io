      <p>
        Welcome to my first post on my Dev Bootcamp blog! I'm excited to share what I've been learning and hopefully someone out there may actually find this helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this first post, I'm going to be discussing the very basics of git, Github and version control.These three things go hand-in-hand with each other and provide software developers with many tools to edit and share code. Let's start with talking about git and version control (which are very closely related) and then we'll move on to discuss Github. You ready? I hope so...
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-over">
      <h3 class="strong">Git and version control</h3>
      <p>
        Now, before we even get into talking about git, we have to take a look at version control. What is version control? Well, simply put, it's a system that helps track changes on a file. Version control allows a developer to save different versions of the same file as a means to track progress on a project and switch between different versions in the event a problem arises. It's kind of like saving multiple versions of a word processing file. You may have your first draft saved as "Essay-Draft 1", then you make some revisions and save that as "Essay Draft-2" and so on. Just like this practice is helpful if you don't like a change and want to revert back to something from a previous version, version control does the same thing for software developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cool thing here, though, is that version control tracks these changes behind the scenes, so you don't have to actively track them youself. The only catch is that you need to tell the system when you would like to make an "official" version of the changes being tracked. I use "official" in quotes because that's not the proper terminology, but the process of completing a change makes it seem like that. So, let's say a developer is working on a file for a website. They're using a version control system, so any change they are making is being tracked simulatenously as they work. So, they've finished their work and want to submit those changes. In order for the version control system to recognize that all of those changes are final, the developer needs to commit them. A commit is like a save point in one's work, and provides information about the time of the save, any notes about the save, and gives it a unique ID that can be referenced in the future. The commit tells the version control system that any and all changes made should be put to record and should be able to be accessed at any time in the future. The commit is like saving a new draft in a word processing system, but version control is a bit smarter in that it helps developers know exactly when and what changes were made at any given commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm sure that was a bit much to take in, but this next portion may be a bit easier to swallow. Now that we've got a semblance of an understanding about version control, I can tell you that git is just simply a type of version control system. In fact, git is what's called a distributed version control system, meaning that any person working on a file (or files) has access not just to that file, but also to it's history of changes. This is a very important feature of git and one of the big ways that it helps developer's track changes. For one, git allows for a file to be worked on by multiple people, even if they are located all over the world. All each person needs is the internet to share the work he or she has been doing; other than that, all changes to the file and its history are maintained locally (on one's own computer). In addition, git helps to protect a file from being completely destroyed in the event someone's hard drive crashes or other unforseen circumstances. In this case, if the file has been shared with others, it's entire history is still intact on those machines and can be restored to the person who had the misfortune of losing it. In other version control systems, which are called centralized, the ability to track changes requires access to a remote server, leaving the file in question vulnerable to being destroyed.

      <p>
        Ok, so we know version control is a system that helps developers track and commit changes to a file, and we know git is a type of version control system. So, what is Github? Github is kind of exactly what it's called: it's a hub for git files. Well, OK, maybe that's not as clear as I thought. Let's back up a moment. Github is a website that hosts git files. A user can create a profile on Github, which will give them a convenient "hub" to store repositories remotely. A repository, if you're curious, is a folder that is equipped with git and can store text files to be tracked using version control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Github is useful because it gives a developer a place to remotely store a whole mess of projects and share them with anyone who has access to the files. This helps a developer free up space on his or her local hard drive and makes working on projects within a team incredibly easy. Git has this very awesome tool in which it can clone repositories, and Github makes great use of that by providing each Github repository with its own unique link for cloning. And once the repository is cloned from Github to one's machine, it can be changed and tracked just as if someone made that git repository locally. Github provides a great deal of freedom for developers to work and share files and repositories, creating a more collaborative coding environment.

          OK, wow. I felt like that was a ton of info in a very short amount of time. At least it felt like that for me. I hope this made some sense and you have a better idea of git, version control and Github. Be on the lookout for my next post.
