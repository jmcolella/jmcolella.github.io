How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was an interesting experience becasue I feel like wireframing is a more personal experience, particularly when it's for a website about an individual. If we were working on the same webpage, I think the experience would have been more collaborative since we both would have had the same goal. Not to say this experience wasn't collaborative, I actually took the idea for the blog post navigation from my pair, but we kind of went our separate ways and then just checked in once we were done wireframing. Writing the HTML was great because I got to navigate and not have to get bogged down with writing everything out. Joking aside, my pair and I had a good workflow writing out the code and were on the same page with what tags to use and howto structure everything out.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I really enjoy wirefrming becasue it helps to merge my visually-oriented mind with that of writing out code. If I have a visual representation of where I want the code to go, then I have a much easier time writing out the HTML, and wireframing allows me to do just that. I had always been one to outline papers in college, and I see the wireframe as similar to an outline: it isn't the be-all end-all of the process, but it at least gives me a good direction to start with and I can mold the process through writing the HTML.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We decided that a good wireframe really shouldn't be bogged down with too many details. We found it important that a wireframe communicate the gist of what a webpage should look like, and that nitty gritty details would get in the way of communicating that message. As I said before, it's like an outline, and one usually doesn't know the specifics during the outline phase, so it doesn't make sense to force details into a wireframe when the code probably isn't even written yet. We approached wireframing as a way to help us structure our HTML and give us guidance as to what tags to use and in what order we would want to write out the different parts/sections of the webpage.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  I learned about the main tag from my pair. I had never seen it before, but she described it as a tag that helps particulalry with those who are blind, as it tells a web browser what is the most important content on the page. I thought that was a useful tag to incorporate, so I put I wrapped it around my post section of this webpage, so that a browser knows this part is the most important part of the webpage.
